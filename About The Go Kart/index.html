        <h1>Our Go-Kart: The Heart of Our EVolocity Project</h1>
        <p>
            Our go-kart is a labour of passion, creativity, and teamwork.
            Built with cutting-edge components and a focus on sustainability,
            it reflects our dedication to learning and innovation.
            While we're still in the process of refining and perfecting our design,
            here’s a glimpse into what powers our electric go-kart and the choices we’re making along the way:
        </p>
        <h2>Key Components:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    BAC4000 Motor Controller:
                    The brain behind our go-kart,
                    the BAC4000 motor controller ensures efficient power delivery and precise control.
                    This advanced controller allows us to fine-tune performance,
                    giving us the edge we need on the track.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Surron Light Bee Motor:
                    At the heart of our go-kart is the Surron Light Bee motor,
                    known for its reliability and power.
                    This motor offers the perfect balance of speed and torque,
                    making it ideal for competitive racing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custom-Made Battery (Samsung 50S Cells):
                    Powering our go-kart is a custom-built battery pack using Samsung 50S cells.
                    Designed and assembled by our team,
                    this battery provides the energy needed to keep our go-kart running smoothly and efficiently.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Frame Design:
        </h2>
        <p>
            We’re currently at a crossroads in our design process,
            deciding between two key options for our go-kart’s frame:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Premade Frame with Modifications:
                    One option is to purchase a premade go-kart frame and modify it to fit our specific needs.
                    This approach could save time and allow us to focus on optimising other aspects of our kart.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custom-Built Frame from Scratch:
                    Alternatively, we’re considering designing and building our own frame from scratch using aluminium.
                    While this option would give us complete control over the design and structure,
                    we’re evaluating whether we have enough time to complete it within our project timeline.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What’s Next:</h2>
        <p>
            Our journey is far from over,
            and we’re continuously working on optimising and improving our go-kart.
            As we finalise our frame decision and continue to fine-tune other components,
            we’ll share more details about our design and progress.
            Stay tuned as we push forward in our quest to build a go-kart that’s not only fast and efficient but also a true reflection of our team’s hard work and dedication.
